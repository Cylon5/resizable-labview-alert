# resizable-labview-alert
Demo of a resizable, modal alert dialog in LabVIEW

Splitter bars can be used to create a LabVIEW panel that resizes without any coding, but setting them up correctly can be challenging.

This project will demonstrate the fundamentals:
- using Classic splitter bar styles in the window background color
- configuring splitter bar options (e.g. "stick right") to get the desired resize behavior
- locking splitter bars
- having controls resize to fit to their pane fluidly while the user resizes the window
